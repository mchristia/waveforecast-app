# Aloha Wave forecast

As passionate surfer my self, knowing the conditions is important for a good surf experience. 
Within a 4 week project I was able to create my first App ever representing how I imagine 
a forecast should present important information.
The App shows the most important information like wave height and period, as well as water 
temperature, the direction of wind and wind speed. Even a forecast of this information of 3
days is easy to see in a table. Every surf spot is being shown on the maps as well.

#Setup
Frontend:
simply `npm install` and `npm start`

Backend:
A Stromglass API Key is necessary in order to fetch the API Data. 

All Surf Spots where added manually, since there was no API I could find providing them. A
dump of my DB can be found in my project. The MongoDB name is *WaveForecast*.
